# Zika Surveillance Project

## Background

The numbers of Zika and associated microcephaly cases are on the rise, yet poor field data remains a barrier to accurate diagnosis and surveillance.

Unmet needs that a Zika surveillance app could address:
* Understanding of high-risk and low-risk geographical areas and patients
* Understanding of patient symptoms that correlate with good/poor clinical endpoints
* Public awareness and education of risk factors for Zika

## Methods (App Development and Implementation)

The app will be developed and tested using the tools described below:

A pilot version will be deployed in an urban setting such as Medellin, Colombia to determine the effectiveness of the app in reliable data collection.
